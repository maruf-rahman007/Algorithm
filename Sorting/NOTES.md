# Selection Sort 
    It's an algorithm where we select/get the minimum value and place it in the start of the array. (Get the minimum and swap)
    Time complexity
    O(n^2) -> Best , worst , Average
1. Select minimum and swap it with current index value
2. Currnt will go forward and from current index to last index the array is unsorted so perform the same operation

# Bubble Sort
    Push the maximum to the last by adjecent swaps
    Time complexity
    O(n^2) -> worst , Average
    O(n) -> Best 
1. The outer loop will run in reverse 
2. Inner loop will run from 0 to i(out loop cur idx) ,check and swap 

# Insertion Sort
    Takes an element and place it to it's currect position
    Time complexity
    O(n^2) -> worst , Average
    O(n) -> Best 
1. Take an element and check if it's in the current position or not 
2. if not then start swaping till it can be swaped/j > 0 


# Merge Sort 
    Divide and Merge

# Quick Sort 
    pick a pivot
    plce it in the proper position/place
    smaller on the left , larger on the right
