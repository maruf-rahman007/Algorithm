# Basics
### Recursion 
->  When a function call itself until a spacific condition is met 

### Stack Overflow
->  Whenever recursion calls are executed, theyâ€™re simultaneously stored in a recursion stack
 where they wait for the completion of the recursive function. A recursive function can only 
 be completed if a base condition is fulfilled and the control returns to the parent function. 
But, when there is no base condition given for a particular recursive function, it gets called 
indefinitely which results in a Stack Overflow i.e, exceeding the memory limit of the recursion 
stack and hence the program terminates giving a Segmentation Fault error. 

### Base Condition
->  To avoid the Stack Overflow we need to add a end point/condition for the perticular function
and that is called base condition

### Recursive Tree
->  A recursive tree is basically a representative form of recursion which depicts how functions 
are called and returned as a series of events happening consecutively. 

# Problems:
* Understand recursion by printing something N times
* Print name N times using recursion
* Print 1 to N using recursion
* Print N to 1 using recursion
* Sum of first N numbers
* Factorial of N numbers
* Reverse an array
* Check if a string is palindrome or not
* Fibonacci Number
